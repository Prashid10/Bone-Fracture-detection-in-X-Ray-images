# Bone Fracture Detection from X-ray Images using XGBoost

This project implements an automated **Bone Fracture Detection system** that analyzes X-ray images and classifies them as **Fractured** or **Not Fractured** using the **XGBoost** machine learning model. The project focuses on classical machine learning with feature extraction (instead of deep learning), making it lightweight and fast.
